ToDo:


- correct zoom/pan interaction (KursDDE00005.pas): in Delphi (ssRight in Shift) seems to have been a check if RMB was pressed, Lazarus seems to regard ssRight like ssShift, i.e. Shift pressed

- adjust layout and alignment of GUI components

- use SVG drawer as exporter

- make intro video work
-- BGRABitmap package contains TAnimatedGif http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=24983.0 or separately: http://consume.o2switch.net/lazarus/animatedgif.zip http://consume.o2switch.net/lazarus/testgif.zip
--- TAnimatedGif needs LCL package with gtkDef and gtkproc, which can be enabled in package manager showing contents of LCL -> fitler gtk -> tick "use unit" => needs write access and recompilation of LCL, stopped at changing write access
-- Wile64 http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Wile64 has TGifAnim but is not maintened any more: http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,14884.msg79328.html#msg79328


Done:

- moved drawing event

- TChart bug

- ported to Lazarus

- gittized Delphi versions
