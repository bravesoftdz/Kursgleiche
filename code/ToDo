ToDo:


- correct zoom/pan interaction (KursDDE00005.pas): in Delphi (ssRight in Shift) seems to have been a check if RMB was pressed, Lazarus seems to regard ssRight like ssShift, i.e. Shift pressed

- adjust layout and alignment of GUI components

- use SVG drawer as exporter

- make intro video work


Done:

- moved drawing event

- TChart bug

- ported to Lazarus

- gittized Delphi versions
